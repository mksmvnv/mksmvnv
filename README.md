Hey 大家好! I'm [@mksmvnv](https://github.com/mksmvnv) Maksim Ivanov.

I'm a Python developer from Saint Petersburg, Russia.

I'm a student at [School 21](https://21-school.ru/) (an educational program by Sber) and currently work as a technical support engineer at [Sprinthost](https://sprintbox.ru/) (a hosting provider).

My hobbies include learning languages, sports, and traveling. My English level is intermediate (B1), and my Chinese is elementary (HSK1). I love reading about IT, Philosophy, and History.
